## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello, my name is Tiago Trindade. I am a molecular Biosciences student from Heidelberg University and currently completely new to Github! 

Recently I developed a Temperature/Time Prediction Tool for Developmental Stages of Medaka, the model organism im working with! This was done with Python and I created a GUI with React.

Currently very interested in learning how to work with CNNs or in general machine learning and contributing on Projects with others!
